## Buzzfeed Quiz Name Scraper

This is a scraper for Buzzfeed quiz titles. 

After pip installing requirements.txt, running buzzfeed_quiz_scraper.py should prompt you for a category and a number of pages 1-7 (navigate options with up and down arrows). Right now it looks like the urls I'm using only work for 7 pages, still looking for a workaround.

This should store a file with all the quiz titles from those pages in the "Results" folder, under the subcategory and current date. 

At this moment the Results folder contains the maximum possible scrape from October 9th at about 9:45PM.
